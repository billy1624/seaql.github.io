## FAQ.02 Why the empty enum `Relation {}` is needed even if an Entity has no relations?

Consider the following example [Post](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/blob/master/examples/actix_example/entity/src/post.rs) Entity:

```rust
use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, DeriveEntityModel)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "posts")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub text: String,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
pub enum Relation {}

impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
```

The two lines for defining `Relation` is quite unnecessary right?

To explain the problem, let's dive slightly deeper into the macro-expanded entity:

The `DeriveRelation` macro simply implements the `RelationTrait`:

```rust
impl RelationTrait for Relation {
    fn def(&self) -> RelationDef {
        match self {
            _ => unreachable!()
        }
    }
}
```

Which in turn is needed by `EntityTrait` as an associated type:

```rust
impl EntityTrait for Entity {
    type Relation = Relation;
    ...
}
```

It would be ideal if, when the user does not specify this associated type, the library automatically fills in a stub to satisfy the type system?

Turns out, there is such a feature in Rust! It is an unstable feature called [`associated_type_defaults`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2532-associated-type-defaults.html).

Basically, it allows trait definitions to specify a default associated type, allowing it to be elided:

```rust
// only compiles in nightly
trait EntityTrait {
    type Relation: Relation = EmptyRelation;
}
```

Due to our commitment to stable Rust, this may not land in SeaORM very soon. When it is stabilized, do remind us to implement this feature to get rid of those two lines!
