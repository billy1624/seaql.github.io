# Tutorial & Examples

If you prefer a step-by-step tutorial on how to use SeaORM, you can check out our official [SeaORM Tutorial](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-tutorial/). There are also some good tutorial written by [the community](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/blob/master/COMMUNITY.md#learning-resources)!

You can also check out [SeaORM Cookbook](https://www.sea-ql.org/sea-orm-cookbook/) for some frequently asked questions and recommended practices of SeaORM.

[Seaography](https://www.sea-ql.org/Seaography/) is a GraphQL framework for building GraphQL resolvers using SeaORM entities.
